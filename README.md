# AP Computer Science Principles Portfolio

I turned this into collegeboard in April 2020.
This was during COVID-19 so the format maybe outdated.

I got a 4.

My Create task was making a maze game with enemies and keys that need to be collected.
My explore task was AI-based predictive analytics in Cancer Treatment.

The course really opened my eyes to widespread use of computers in every day lif and power it carries.
